# taco on flake

nix home-manager configs created by [fleek](https://github.com/ublue-os/fleek), which died. so now it's my own frosted flake config.

## reference

- [home-manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/)
- [home-manager options](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.html)

## usage

aliases were added by fleek to the config to make it easier to use. to use them, run the following command:

```bash
$ apply-$(hostname)
```
for example:
```
$ apply-myna
```
on `myna`.
